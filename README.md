# SIBD
We developed this website for our Information Systems and Databases course with the objective of proving that we learned how to build a website from the ground-up, this includes  PHP + HTML + CSS + SQL. We used Docker to test the website in our local loopback, but we plan to keep on working on it and maybe launch it on a public domain someday.
